Shows an image of Vigo the Carpathian, whose eyes remain closed until "he" (the Kinect) spots a moving target, at which point they snap open, and then follow the target until that target moves off frame.

This uses no skeleton tracking, just passive user identification and tracking. It is not perfect; Vigo is known to become fixated on walls and pillars, though he seems to lose interest in them easily when a person walks in front.
